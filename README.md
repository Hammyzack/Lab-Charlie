## How to use Angular

The code below gives the user access to the main controller along with links to get to my repo.
```
<body ng-app="My-Angular">
    <div class="container-fluid" ng-controller="MainController">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                <a href="https://github.com/Hammyzack/Lab-Charlie" target="_blank">link to my repo</a><br>
                <a href="https://github.com/Hammyzack/Lab-Charlie/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">Writing a file to a server instructions</a>              
            </div>
        </div>
```

The user then will see the **html** that was created that will display **My-Angular** with my name. It will also ask them if they are lost or confused. Then it continues by giving them `URL Links` to help them get to where they need to be. Below is the code that displays the main page for the html.

```
<div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                <h1 id="page-title">My-Angular</h1>
                <input ng-model="user.name">
                <h3 id="user-greeting">Welcome I'm Hammy, {{ user.name }}</h3>
                <p id="user-car">Lost or confused{{ user.car }}? Click on the links above!!</p>
            </div>
```
